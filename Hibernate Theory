Hibernate Framework:
- Hibernate is a high performance object/relational persistence and query service
- it is an open source and free to download
- it is lightweight, ORM(Object Relational Mapping) tool
- hibernate not only take care of mapping from java classes to database tables and from java datatype to sql datatypes but also provides db query and retrieval facility.
- ORM tool simplifies data creation, data manipulation and data access.
- it internally uses JDBC API to interact with the database.

Advantages:
1.Opensource and lightweight
2.Fast Performance
- Performance is fast because cache is internally used in hibernate
- there are 2 types of cache, 1st level cache and 2nd level cache
- 1st level cache is enabled by default.

3.Database Independent Query:
- Hibernate uses HQL(Hibernate Query Language) instead of SQL. HQL is Object Oriented version of SQL.
- it generates database independent queries, you don't need to write database specific queries.
- before hibernate if database is changed for the project,we need to change the sql query as well that leads to maintainance problem

4.Automatic table creation:
- provides facility to create tables automatically.

5.Simplifies complex join:
- to fetch data from multiple tables is easy in hibernate

6.Query statistics and database support
- it support query cache and provides statistic about query and database status.

Hibernate Architecture:
There are four layers, Java application layer, Hibernate Framework layer, Backend API layer and database layer

Elements of Hibernate Architecture:

SessionFactory:
- it is factory of session and client of connection provider.
- it holds 2nd level(optional) of data
- org.hibernate.SessionFactory interface provides factory to get the object of session.

Session:
- provides interface between the application and data store in database
- it wraps the JDBC connection and it is a factory of Transaction, Query and Criteria.
- it holds 1st level cache(mandatory) of data.
- it provides methods to insert, update and delete the object.

Transaction:
- provides methods for transaction management.ex.commit()

ConnectionProvider:
- it is factory of JDBC Connection
- it abstract the application from DriverManager
